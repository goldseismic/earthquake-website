<h3 id="event-selection">Event Selection</h3>
<p>
  Seismic design codes often are based on a probabilistic seismic hazard
  analysis and also a deterministic seismic hazard analysis. While a
  probabilistic analysis accounts for all possible ruptures, a deterministic
  analysis only considers a representative subset of ruptures that are based on
  the same models of earthquake sources as the probabilistic analysis. The
  deterministic subset of ruptures are characteristic earthquakes on all known
  actives faults. This catalog includes the deterministic ruptures from the
  2014 version of the USGS national seismic hazard maps.

<h3 id="ground-motion-models">Ground Motion Models</h3>
<p>
  For a given rupture, the ground motion shaking intensity parameters are
  computed using a weighted combination of ground motion models for reference
  rock conditions that is consistent with the 2014 version of the USGS national
  seismic hazard maps.

<h3 id="site-response">Site Response</h3>
<p>
  The 2014 USGS seismic hazard maps do not account for site response directly.
  Site conditions are accounted for in the building code separately. However,
  the scenarios in this catalog include site response in the maps, based on
  maps of the time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (VS30). The
  input VS30 grids are a combination of regionally variable models that are
  available at
